## Installation 🔧

### For the frontend:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the frontend repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nour-ezzehi/hopePulse_frontend.git
    ```

2. **Install Frontend Packages**: Navigate to the cloned frontend directory and install the required packages using npm:

    ```bash
    cd hopePulse_frontend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Frontend Development Server**: Once the packages are installed, start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will compile the frontend code and start a development server. You can access the frontend application at the specified address (usually `http://localhost:3000`) in your web browser.

Now, your frontend development environment should be set up and ready for development.

### For the backend:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the backend repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nour-ezzehi/hopePulse_backend.git
    ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**: Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment. Activate the virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip, the Python package manager, to install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install django djangorestframework djangorestframework-simplejwt djoser psycopg2
    ```

    This command will install Django, Django Rest Framework, JWT Authentication, Djoser, and the PostgreSQL adapter psycopg2 along with their dependencies.

4. **Set Up PostgreSQL Database**: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed on your system. Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the database settings in the `settings.py` file of your Django project.

5. **Apply Database Migrations**: Run the following command to apply database migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Start the Backend Server**: Once the database is set up and migrations are applied, start the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

Now, your backend server should be up and running, ready to handle requests from the frontend.
